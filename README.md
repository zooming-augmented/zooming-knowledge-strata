# zooming-knowledge-strata

Knowledge here is not static.  
It accumulates in **layers (strata)** through practice, failure, and reflection.

This repository is a living knowledge base where insights evolve over time.

## 🌱 What is this repository?

**zooming-knowledge-strata** is a place to store and grow practical knowledge.

Rather than polished conclusions, it values:
- real experiments
- things that worked
- things that failed
- why they worked or failed
- how they were improved next

Each entry represents one layer in an evolving knowledge landscape.

## 🧠 How knowledge grows here

Knowledge is treated as **strata**, not as a single truth.

A typical flow looks like this:

1. Someone tries a practice
2. The result is recorded (success or failure)
3. Context and assumptions are noted
4. Another person (or the same person later) tries again
5. Improvements are proposed and recorded
6. A new layer is added on top of the previous one

Old layers are never erased.  
They remain as context.

## 📚 What you will find

You may find documents such as:

- practice notes (Markdown)
- failure reports and reflections
- improved procedures derived from experience
- links to related GitHub Issues or discussions
- time-stamped records of who tried what and when

Some knowledge starts rough and becomes refined over time.

## 🤖 About AI support

This repository is maintained by a **human thinker augmented by AI**.

AI is used to:
- support reflection
- connect related ideas
- help structure evolving knowledge

AI does **not** make final decisions.  
Responsibility always remains human.

## 🔁 Living knowledge, not documentation

This is not a traditional documentation repository.

- Entries may change
- New layers may contradict older ones
- Improvement is continuous

Think of this place as a **geological record of thinking**, not a textbook.

---

## 🌍 Philosophy

- Knowledge grows through use
- Failure is valuable data
- Context matters
- Improvement is ongoing
- Sharing strengthens understanding

If this approach resonates with you, feel free to explore and learn from the layers.
